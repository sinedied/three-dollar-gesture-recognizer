The $3 Gesture Recognize is a simple but robust gesture recognition system for input devices featuring 3D acceleration sensors. The algorithm is designed to be implemented quickly in prototyping environments, is intended to be device-independent and does not require any special toolkits or frameworks. It relies solely on simple trigonometric and geometric calculations.
